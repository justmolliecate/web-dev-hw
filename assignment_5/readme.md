<h3>Why would I choose a third party hosting site??</h3>

<p>I personally would choose a third party hosting site because it doesn't take up my bandwidth, I don't need to worry about people downloading it, and quite frankly, it is much easier to do.</p>

<h3>Work Cycle</h3>

<p>For this work cycle, I chose to hightlight Fun. because I have been skiing a lot recently and it is my favorite band to listen to whilst shreddin' the gnar. During the work cycle, I ran into some problems trying to embed the animation because I didn't quite understand the type element. I worked through that by looking for examples online and seeing what I was missing. Everything else was pretty straightforward.</p>

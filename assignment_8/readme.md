Borders  define a property, Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself,  margin is the space between the box/element and other elements.

I didn't even know if we supposed to do this so I didn't try very hard. I know it's messed up. I will probably go back and experiment with this when I have more time.

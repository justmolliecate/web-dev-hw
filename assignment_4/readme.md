<h3>Forms</h3>

  There are too many forms to count. You have subscribe forms, submit forms, upload forms, search forms, find forms, which are where you press command f and find words in a page, which is my favorite, forms for filling out information, login forms..You get the picture.

<h3>Work Cycle</h3>
<p>
 To be perfectly honest, this was a terrible week for this class. Nothing about the material was particularily difficult, but the content took so long to get down and there was just a sheer quantity. My week last week was dedicated to preparing for a few different test, and my weekend was decimated by final budgeting for ASUM, where we sat in a room for 20 hours and allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars to agencies, unions and student groups. On top of that, today I was a part of an interview committee to hire a new ASUM sustainability coordinator, which went until 5:30 p.m. So after that I biked home, opened my laptop and started this entire assignment and am now just almost finished. At 10 p.m. So all the material was fine, it just wasn't a very pleasant work cycle.
